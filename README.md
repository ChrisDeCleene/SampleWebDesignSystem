# Chris DeCleene's Website Design System
> Here is my sample website design system. I built this as part of the Full Stack Engineer Career Path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn). I plan to continue updating as I learn more in my coursework. I will also be using this project as a template for all future website development projects. It is a great way to keep styling consistent and have a reference as the project grows. Feel free to use this on your own projects as well! Happy Coding!

## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Box overlap in the #colors section.
- Footer styling is rigid. Needs better spacing.

To do:
- Move each style to it's own page.
- Add additional styling sections. I.e. Box Styling.
- Improve accessibility.
- Improve mobile responsive.
